      <p><b>Summary</b></p>
      <p1>
        Love… does it mean running around the trees or vacationing in
        Switzerland, singing tra-la-la in the snow? Is it about gifting teddy
        bears and roses to your partner? After losing everything she holds dear…
        her love, her parents, and even her singing, Samaira is dejected. She is
        at her lowest point in life and has no idea what she wants. Vivian is
        the successful and dynamic head of Creative Tanks and dreams of being
        the top entrepreneur in India. When their paths cross, sparks fly and
        they are drawn to each other. The aura of mystery around her tugs at
        Vivian’s heartstrings. While Samaira seems intent on running away from
        love, hope, and her aspirations, Vivian makes it his mission to bring
        her back on track. Thus begins an intriguing journey for both, from the
        end to new beginnings. They chase broken dreams against all odds,
        inspiring one another. As they walk the arduous path of life, will they
        climb the ladder of success together? Or will they crash and burn?
        Sometimes we don’t get second chances and we certainly don’t get second
        chances at living so we should live life at its fullest and if for
        whatever reason we make a mistake or have regrets for choices we made
        and we do get a second chance at making it better, righter then just
        grab the chance given to you by the hair and never let go until you’re
        one hundred percent certain that what you’re doing is right, that it is
        indeed what you want and need and most importantly, love. One Day, Life
        Will Change is a sweet and inspiring story about two characters that are
        complete opposites and very unique in their own way. Samaira was a
        quirky and light-hearted, and I really liked reading about her and
        getting a glimpse at how her mind worked. But after losing everything,
        her love, parents and her career, she’s despondent to any feelings. She
        meets Vivian, a successful and dynamic head of Creative Tanks, and her
        life turned upside down. Vivian tries everything in his hands to bring
        Samaira back on track. The characters are original, quirky and so very
        interesting, they make you want to stop and think about life and all the
        weird and wonderful stuff in it. You will fall in love with the
        characters in this story, especially the two main characters, Samaira
        and Vivian. When we first meet Samaira, she has no idea what she wants
        from her life or her future. But she grows and matures so much
        throughout the novel, she really felt like a completely different person
        by the end of the book, in a good way! As for Vivian, you just couldn’t
        help but fall in love with him as well. Samaira and Vivian have a
        wonderful chemistry together that makes this book wonderful. This is a
        story about inspiration. Samaira met a man who changed her life, changed
        her as a person, she finally started dreaming when she finally realized
        what the world had to offer and what she was missing out. Thanks to
        Vivian she became a person who aspired to do something and not settle
        down for the small life but live big instead.
