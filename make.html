      <p><b>Summary</b></p>
      <p1>
        Life Is What You Make It is mostly set in Kerala in the 1990s. The story
        opens in a mental institution where the protagonist of the novel, Ankita
        Sharma, is apparently brought to unwillingly by her parents. She is 21,
        good-looking and smart, and yet she is there among many people with
        listless looks and lethargic bodies. “I am not like you,” she wants to
        scream. “I won elections in my college. I used to be the Secretary of
        the Arts Association. I was doing my management from a fine business
        school. I am not like you all.” But, unfortunately, she is – just a
        first-time patient at the National Mental Health Institute. So, how did
        she get there? When her number finally comes up, and the doctor starts
        asking her question, we, the readers, slowly but surely start uncovering
        the answer to this question. The flashback starts with two letters
        exchanged between the protagonist and Vaibhav, a childhood friend of
        hers. We learn that Vaibhav has managed to get into the Indian Institute
        of Technology – Delhi, and that Ankita is not allowed to do the same by
        her conservative parents, despite her excellent grades. The reason for
        it is, of course, the gender of Ankita – and nothing more. So,
        expectedly for a girl living in Kerala in 1989, she enters St. Agnes
        College for Girls. However, she misses Vaibhav who, as we learn from the
        letters exchanged between the two, was a little more than a friend to
        her. They say that distance is sometimes capable of sharpening love, but
        they also say that it is a make-or-break test for it. In the case of
        Ankita, it seems to be both. At first, it works in favor of Vaibhav
        whose letters Ankita eagerly awaits – they are not just the highlight of
        her college life, but basically the only thing she looks forward to.
        However, as the days pass, Ankita starts fitting in at St. Agnes. Not
        only she is a great student, acing her tests and excelling in her
        extracurricular activities, she is also an all-rounder adored by
        absolutely everybody. In fact, she is soon elected to be the Arts Club
        Secretary, and, even sooner, makes a lot of friends. One of them,
        Sanjana, introduces her to Abhishek, a stout boy good at playing guitar
        and great at public speaking. We also learn that he has “a roundish face
        that sported slight stubble,” that he wears glasses and that he is
        “friendly and jovial.” And he’s also quite smooth – if not a little
        corny – with the icebreakers, since the second thing he says to Ankita
        as he is shaking her hand is: “So what do you do, apart from being so
        pretty?” And that’s code for “Vaibhav, who?” But that’s also something a
        student at St. Agnes would expect from someone coming from Mahaveer
        College, for the simple reason that “even the best-looking girl at
        Mahaveer, could not match up to an average looking girl at Agnes.” After
        being left alone with Abhi by her classmates following a cultural event,
        Ankita is surprised to find out that she has enjoyed every second of her
        time with her new acquaintance. She is even more surprised when Abhi
        drops the “I love you” bombshell: “I fell in love with you the moment I
        saw you,” he says. “I have never felt like this about anyone before,
        trust me. I am crazy about you. Honestly. And I have never done anything
        like this before in my life. This confessing feelings and all, is just
        not me, but with you I really cannot hold back anymore.” As if he held
        back at all! Ankita rejects his advances by telling him that she has a
        boyfriend, but Abhi is persistent. He sends her a letter and, before too
        long, Ankita visits him at his place. Finally, “during the mother of all
        cultural festivals, the Mahatma Gandhi University Youth Festival,” Abhi
        and Ankita kiss. They start going out, and everything in Ankita’s life
        is looking picture book perfect. Except, you know: as her feelings for
        Abhi start growing, her love for Vaibhab slowly stars fading away:
        Vaibhav and I were still in touch but not with the intensity as earlier.
        I think it was more out of a sense of duty that he called rather than
        anything else. I had not even noticed that his calls had trickled as I
        was so absorbed in Abhi and the other things that were going on in my
        life. I think the love I had for him was replaced by a kind of fond
        affection. Honestly, it did not matter to me anymore whether he called
        or not. It seemed as though Abhi and I had been through so much together
        and somewhere along the way, Vaibhav had been left far behind. Years
        pass and Ankita is obsessed with a new agenda: getting into one of the
        top institutes in the country offering an MBA program. She gets an
        interview call from four of them, one of which is the most well-known
        one located in Bombay! Coincidentally, Ankita’s father is promoted in
        his company at about this time, and this promotion means that all of
        Ankita’s family will be moving to Bombay. It also means that her
        relationship with Abhishek is nearing its end. “Even if my folks were
        not moving to Bombay,” Ankita says to Abhi, “we would still have parted
        as I would have chosen to do it in Bombay.” “Pride has gone to your
        head,” replies Abhi, whom Ankita describes ominously as “an emotional
        fool.” They break up acrimoniously, and the very next day Abhi’s body is
        found; it is discovered that he drowned due to an excessive amount of
        alcohol in his body. And that it may have been a suicide. Only Ankita
        knows that this is undoubtedly related to her. She tells her best friend
        Suvi, and with her help, she calls Abhi’s grandfather. “I know he loved
        you,” he tells her, even though he hides this information from the
        police. “I don’t know what happened between you two, but I have only one
        thing to say. You are young, you are pretty. Please remember molle,
        sneham mathram puchikaruthu. No matter from where it comes.” The closest
        translation that Ankita is able to come up with of these beautiful words
        in Malayam is “never belittle love.” These wise words open a piercing
        hole inside Ankita’s body. And even though in Bombay she is doing what
        she does best – winning the hearts of many and acing all of her exams
        (whilst writing poems and making notes for everybody until late in the
        evening) – she is also, slowly but surely (and also, unwittingly)
        falling down this hole. To make matters worse, her parents discover the
        love letters she had been exchanging with Vaibhav and Abhi. They burn
        them and scold her severely for them. Unsurprisingly, very soon, the
        darkness gets the better of Ankita: depressed and miserable, she tries
        to slit her wrists. And she doesn’t stop at her first suicide attempt:
        the second time it is her father who saves her. And that’s the reason
        why Ankita is admitted to a mental hospital at the beginning of the
        novel.
