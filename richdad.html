      <p><b>Summary</b></p>
      <p1>
        “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is
        temporary. Poor is eternal.” “Money comes and goes, but if you have the
        education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin
        building wealth.” “People’s lives are forever controlled by two
        emotions: fear and greed.” “So many people say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested
        in money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day.” “Thinking
        that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself.” “Intelligence solves
        problems and produces money.” “You must know the difference between an
        asset and a liability, and buy assets.” An asset puts money in your
        pocket. A liability takes money out of your pocket. “Illiteracy, both in
        words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle.” “Money
        often makes obvious our tragic human flaws, putting a spotlight on what
        we don’t know.” “Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles
        money.” “Most people don’t understand why they struggle financially
        because they don’t understand cash flow.” “The number-one expense for
        most people is taxes.” Higher incomes cause higher taxes. This is known
        as “bracket creep.” “More money seldom solves someone’s money problems.”
        “The fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new ways
        to solve their problems.” “A person can be highly educated,
        professionally successful, and financially illiterate.” “Many financial
        problems are caused by trying to keep up with the Joneses.” Once you
        understand the difference between assets and liabilities, concentrate
        your efforts on buying income-generating assets. “The problem with
        simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater
        share of your increased efforts. You need to learn how to have your
        increased efforts benefit you and your family directly.” “Wealth is a
        person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward—or, if I
        stopped working today, how long could I survive?” “The rich buy assets.
        The poor only have expenses. The middle class buy liabilities they think
        are assets.” “The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else
        focuses on their income statements.” “Financial struggle is often
        directly the result of people working all their lives for someone else.”
        “The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget
        to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone
        else’s business and making that person rich.” “To become financially
        secure, a person needs to mind their own business.” “Financial struggle
        is often the result of people working all their lives for someone else.”
        “The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are
        fiscally conservative—which means, ‘I can’t afford to take risks’—is
        that they have no financial foundation.” “One of the main reasons net
        worth is not accurate is simply because, the moment you begin selling
        your assets, you are taxed for any gains.” “A new car loses nearly 25
        percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the
        lot.” “Keep expenses low, reduce liabilities, and diligently build a
        base of solid assets.” Kiyosaki says he owns business that do not
        require his presence. “If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It
        becomes my job.” According to Kiyosaki, real assets fall into the
        following categories: Stocks Bonds Income-generating real estate Notes
        (IOUs) Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and
        patents Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates,
        and has a ready market “For people who hate real estate, they shouldn’t
        buy it.” Kiyosaki generally holds real estate for less than seven years.
        Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying
        real assets, not liabilities.
