      <p>
        Our narrator is a middle-aged man who just attended a funeral for
        someone in his immediate family. He's driving around the town where he
        grew up, because he wants to avoid the social niceties implicit in such
        an event, and finds himself drawn to the farm at the end of the lane
        where he once had a friend named Lettie Hempstock. He finds himself
        asking the old woman there if he could sit by their duck pond and
        reminisce, and then proceeds to relate this extraordinary tale:He is a
        pretty lonely kid (not a single friend shows up for his seventh birthday
        party), who loves to escape into the world of books when he's not busy
        blowing things up in his "laboratory" (a shed to which his father has
        banished his chemistry set). His parents have come across hard times
        financially, and are forced to take in boarders to help supplement their
        income. One of the boarders, a down-on-his-luck opal miner from South
        Africa, decides that their car is the perfect vehicle in which to end
        his life. Gee, thanks dude. When the boy and his father discover the
        body they also meet Lettie Hempstock, a mysterious eleven-year-old girl
        who lives on the farm at the end of the lane with her mother and
        grandmother. The boy is sent with her to keep warm in their kitchen
        while the police sort things out with the dead opal miner, and it's
        there that he realizes these women are not altogether ordinary. They do,
        however, make some really good food. When strange things start happening
        to him, like waking up choking on an old coin, he seeks out Lettie
        because she seems like she's got all the answers. The two of them go on
        an adventure to bind the creature that is throwing money at people, but
        during this process things go south. The thing (that Lettie's Gran
        refers to as a "flea") manages to make the boy a doorway from her world
        into ours, and she introduces herself to his family as Ursula
        Monkton—their latest boarder and childcare provider extraordinaire.His
        whole family is enthralled with her, especially because she has
        impeccable timing, but the boy knows there's something just not right.
        She tries to make sure that he never leaves their property again, and in
        the process possesses his father to commit attempted filicide. The boy
        just barely escapes being drowned in his own bathtub and runs to the
        Hempstock farm. The Hempstock women—Gran, Ginnie, and Lettie—patch him
        up and try to remove the rest of the magical doorway that Ursula has
        embedded in his body, but a part of it is too deeply ingrained in his
        heart. So when they finally convince Ursula to take the doorway back to
        her own world, she says she can't without tearing him apart. Yikes.
        That's when Lettie summons the "varmints" to finish her off,
        hunger-birds that act as inter-dimensional cleaners who eat things as a
        way of preventing them from proliferating where they don't belong.
        (We're pretty sure that we are "varmints" when it comes to Girl Scout
        cookies. Someone has to keep them in line.) Unfortunately, after they
        eat Ursula Monkton the varmints decide that they absolutely, positively,
        cannot go back to their own dimension until they eat the piece of the
        doorway that is left in the boy's heart as well. When they go after him,
        Lettie sacrifices herself to save his life. Gran and Ginnie come to the
        rescue and banish the varmints, but not before they manage to kind-of
        kill Lettie. (She's not quite dead, really, but she's very badly hurt.)
