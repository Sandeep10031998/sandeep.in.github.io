      <p>
        Where did the universe and everything in it come from, and where is it
        all headed? New technology has allowed modern science to offer answers
        to such questions. First, Stephen Hawking details some of the major
        scientific breakthroughs throughout history that have brought our
        understanding to this point. Though in Ancient Greece people worked out
        that the earth is round, thinkers such as Aristotle still thought the
        earth was at the center of everything else. This theory wasn’t really
        challenged until 1514, when Nicholas Copernicus showed that the planets,
        including the earth, orbit the sun. In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton devised
        his own laws related to gravity, theorized that all stars should exert
        this force on one another, and wondered whether the universe was
        infinite. In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies everywhere are
        rapidly moving away from each other. The idea that the universe is
        expanding, in turn, suggested there was a time when everything was in a
        single, tiny, infinitely dense place. God, Hawking notes, could fit into
        this theory. Science’s ultimate goal is to find one theory that ties all
        the others together. For now, the two main partial theories scientists
        have include the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. The
        former focuses on gravity and massive celestial bodies, while the latter
        deals with the tiniest types of matter known to humanity. These theories
        are inconsistent with each other, however. Scientists are still search
        for a unifying theory to fulfill to the deepest longing of humankind: to
        understand where we come from. Newton put forth the idea that objects
        are naturally in motion, and that forces cause them to speed up or slow
        down. This challenges the idea of absolute space; think of a ping pong
        ball bouncing on a train going 40 miles an hour. The distance the ball
        has moved according to someone on the moving train will be very
        different when compared to the observation of someone outside the train.
        The idea of absolute time, however, took longer to overcome. In 1865,
        James Clerk Maxwell discovered that light has different wavelengths,
        such as radio waves or microwaves. Albert Einstein later pointed out
        that light always moves at the same speed and is faster than anything
        else in his theory of relativity. The general theory of relativity also
        put forth that gravity warps—bends and curves—space-time. For example,
        time moves more slowly near objects with larger masses. Thus, though
        space and time affect objects’ movements, objects’ movements also affect
        space and time; neither is absolute. Einstein also proposed a sort of
        antigravity force, or cosmological constant, that would repel objects
        and explain the (incorrectly) assumed static nature of the universe. In
        the mid 18th century, astronomers identified the Milky Way and described
        it as a spiral galaxy. In the 20th century, Hubble showed that there are
        galaxies other than our own—and from the red shift seen in these far-off
        stars, it is clear that these galaxies are moving away from us. This
        explains why the universe is not collapsing in on itself, without the
        need for Einstein’s cosmological constant—which Einstein deemed the
        worst mistake of his career. Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann
        suggested that the universe looks roughly the same in all directions.
        This was later proven by measuring the universe’s uniform microwave
        radiation. Friedmann also offered various models of the universe, both
        finite and infinite, with most featuring a big bang at the beginning.
        Wider acceptance of the big bang theory came with Roger Penrose’s work
        on black holes, which occur when matter collapses in on itself until it
        takes up zero size and is infinitely dense. Hawking, then a doctoral
        student, saw the relevance of the reverse version of this for the big
        bang theory, and later released a paper to that effect with Penrose.
